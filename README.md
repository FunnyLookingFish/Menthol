# Description 

This project is a full stack single page MERN application in a user friendly format. The application allows a user to track their expenses vs income, and add or remove expnses as they relate to the user. It combines a scalable MongoDB back end, a GraphQL API, and an Express.js and Node.js server with a React front end, implementing user authentication with JWT to build a user-focused platform.

# Usage
